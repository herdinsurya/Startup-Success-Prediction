<h1 align="center">Startup Success Prediction Model</h1>

# Objectives
Building a model to predict startup success rate.

# About Dataset
This dataset is obtained from [Startup Success Prediction | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manishkc06/startup-success-prediction)

# Main Instructions
1. Exploratory analysis from the data, create some visualization to describe the data
2. Describe the pre-processing step and the reason behind them
3. Split the data into training and testing with optional portion
4. Build the models with matching hyperparameter tune, choose the best model, also the reason behind that (still need improvement with some additional algorithm)
5. Test the model with data test (acquired by removing target labels in the dataset)

# Requirements
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Web browser (Chrome)
